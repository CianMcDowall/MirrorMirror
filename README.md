Mirror Mirror
============

Mirror Mirror is the software I created for my Magic Mirror project. It shows the weather at 3 different locations, currently set to my suburb, work, and University.

Currently consists of a weather forecast, the time, the date, lcoal news, and world news.

Make first argument 1 for testing purposes, 2 for functional purposes. 

Use guardian news API key as second argument. Will still work without, just will not display news.

Code is not commented.

#Known bugs
