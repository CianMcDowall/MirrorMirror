Mirror Mirror
============

Mirror Mirror is the software I created for my Magic Mirror project. It shows the weather at 3 different locations, currently set to my suburb, work, and University.

Currently consists of a weather forecast, the time, and the date. In the future I am planning on a calendar integration.

Code is not commented.

#Known bugs
3rd party weather API is inconsistent.
Only updates weather every hour.
